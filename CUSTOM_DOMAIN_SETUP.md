### **Step 2: DNS Configuration**

TTL: 3600
```

**CNAME Record (for www subdomain):**

```

**Alternative: CNAME for Apex Domain (if supported by DNS provider):**

TTL: 3600
```

**For Cloudflare:**

### **Step 3: SSL Certificate Configuration**

   - Usually takes 24-48 hours for full propagation

2. **Force HTTPS Redirect**
   - In Netlify Domain settings
   - Enable "Force HTTPS" option
   - This redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS

3. **HSTS Configuration**
   - Add security headers in netlify.toml
   - Enhance security and SEO performance

---

### **Step 4: Netlify Configuration Updates**

Update netlify.toml with custom domain optimizations:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "."
  command = "node build.js && echo 'CUSTOM DOMAIN DEPLOYMENT'"
  functions = "netlify/functions"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    Strict-Transport-Security = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"

[[headers]]
  for = "*.css"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "*.jpg"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "*.png"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[redirects]]
  from = "https://www.midasthelifestyle.com/*"
  to = "https://midasthelifestyle.com/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "http://midasthelifestyle.com/*"
  to = "https://midasthelifestyle.com/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "http://www.midasthelifestyle.com/*"

  status = 301
  force = true
